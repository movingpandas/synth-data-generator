# Synthetic movement data generation using Mesa

## About Mesa

[Mesa](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa) allows users to quickly create agent-based models using built-in
core components (such as spatial grids and agent schedulers) or
customized implementations; visualize them using a browser-based
interface; and analyze their results using Python's data analysis
tools. Its goal is to be the Python-based alternative to NetLogo,
Repast, or MASON.

## Installation

``` bash
pip install mesa==2.4.0 shapely movingpandas
```

## User guide

To use the generators, follow the instructions in corresponding directory:
